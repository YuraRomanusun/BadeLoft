                        <h4>1Why are other stone resin bathtubs found online so much more expensive? </h4>
                        <p>Badeloft USA sells its products directly to its clients and rarely does business with retailers and wholesalers. Being the exclusive US seller of Badeloft bathtubs, we can offer you products at the most competitive price. </p>
                        <h4>What is included in the shipment of the bathtubs? </h4>
                        <p>Each tub is wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap with Styrofoam lining the top rim. All of our tubs arrive with a standard pop-up drain plug already installed and lined up with the integrated overflow system which makes it completely freestanding so it can in essence be installed anywhere in the room. You can use our EZ-Drop-in Drain (some restrictions apply) or your plumber will need to purchase (from a hardware store, etc.) a flanged tail piece and p-trap to attach to the bottom of that inch and a half diameter threaded drain coming out of the bottom of the tub. Please refer to each product’s More Information section for further info. </p>
                        <h4>What is included in the shipment of the freestanding sinks?</h4>
                        <p>The shipment includes the sink, drain system and pop-up plug. Some of our sinks come with built-in overflow protection included. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information.</p>
                        <h4>What is included in the shipment of the wall-mounted sinks?</h4>
                        <p>The shipment includes the sink, the pop-up drain plug and hardware. A set of stainless steel wall-mount brackets are included with all wall-mount sinks except the WT-07. Please note, not all of our wall-mounted sink models feature a pop-up drain plug or a built-in overflow. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information. </p>
                        <h4>What is included in the shipment of the counter top sinks? </h4>
                        <p>The shipment includes the sink and the pop-up drain plug. Please note that our counter top sinks do not feature the built-in overflow. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information. </p>
                        <h4>What is UPC? Why should I care if a product is UPC/cUPC tested and certified? </h4>
                        <p>The Uniform Plumbing Code™ (UPC™) and Canadian Uniform Plumbing Code™ (cUPC™) are designated as the American and Canadian national standards, respectively. These codes are designed to provide consumers with safe and sanitary plumbing systems. Commercial construction projects, as well as many residential construction projects, normally require specified products to be certified. Badeloft sinks and bathtubs are UPC/cUPC certified, facilitating their use in all types of projects. </p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Is the weight of the tub something I should consider when buying a Badeloft USA bathtub? </h4>
                        <p>Provided that the building is structurally sound, the weight of the filled bathtub (i.e., approximately the weight of 5 adults) should not be of concern. If you do not know if your building can support this weight, please consult an engineer/architect. </p>
                        <h4>What is the insulation capacity or heat capacity of stone resin?</h4>
                        <p>The insulation capacity of stone resin is very efficient; however, the surface area of the bathtub is large and hot water evaporates. To extend your bathing time for as long as possible, we recommend that you run the water hot to start and cool it down as the bath fills up. </p>
                        <h4>What is the difference between a matte and gloss finish? </h4>
                        <p>Regarding the finishes, it really comes down to your design, what kind of look you are going for and personal preference. The biggest difference between the two is one is shiny and one is not. For our tubs, the Matte finish is the better seller. It gives a more contemporary, modern look. Most clients feel, if they are going to buy a tub like ours, they want it to be the focal point of their bathroom and if the toilet and sinks are already in a Glossy finish, the tub being in Matte will help it stand out or 'pop' more. However, like anything in Matte, it shows 'use' more often and (depending how often it is being used) requires a tad more conscious proactive cleaning. i.e. a little spray and wipe down after use, etc. The Gloss will be a tad easier to clean due to the sleekness of it. A great quality of Stone Resin is after time, if you accidentally scratch it, scuff it, smudge it, even chip it, you can fix it. You cannot do the with acrylic, fiber glass, iron tubs. It is easier to fix the Matte finish as you do not have the added extra step of re-applying the gloss polish to the compromised area with the Gloss finish, however, both can be fixed. To see these two styles for yourself, please request a free 4”X4” material sample from Badeloft USA. </p>
                        <h4>Do the wall-mounted sinks and counter top sinks already have sink holes for the faucets? </h4>
                        <p>All of our sinks do not arrive pre-drilled faucet holes. This way, you have the choice to use either a wall-mount or deck mount faucet. The sink holes for the faucets can be easily drilled in 5 minutes if your read and follow the below drilling guidelines:</p>

                            <h4>What is included in the shipment of the bathtubs? </h4>
                            <p>Each tub is wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap with Styrofoam lining the top rim. All of our tubs arrive with a standard pop-up drain plug already installed and lined up with the integrated overflow system which makes it completely freestanding so it can in essence be installed anywhere in the room. You can use our EZ-Drop-in Drain (some restrictions apply) or your plumber will need to purchase (from a hardware store, etc.) a flanged tail piece and p-trap to attach to the bottom of that inch and a half diameter threaded drain coming out of the bottom of the tub. Please refer to each product’s More Information section for further info. </p>
                            <h4>What is included in the shipment of the freestanding sinks?</h4>
                            <p>The shipment includes the sink, drain system and pop-up plug. Some of our sinks come with built-in overflow protection included. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information.</p>
                            <h4>What is included in the shipment of the wall-mounted sinks?</h4>
                            <p>The shipment includes the sink, the pop-up drain plug and hardware. A set of stainless steel wall-mount brackets are included with all wall-mount sinks except the WT-07. Please note, not all of our wall-mounted sink models feature a pop-up drain plug or a built-in overflow. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information. </p>
                            <h4>What is included in the shipment of the counter top sinks? </h4>
                            <p>The shipment includes the sink and the pop-up drain plug. Please note that our counter top sinks do not feature the built-in overflow. Please refer to each product’s data sheet in Downloads for more information. </p>
                            <h4>What is UPC? Why should I care if a product is UPC/cUPC tested and certified? </h4>
                            <p>The Uniform Plumbing Code™ (UPC™) and Canadian Uniform Plumbing Code™ (cUPC™) are designated as the American and Canadian national standards, respectively. These codes are designed to provide consumers with safe and sanitary plumbing systems. Commercial construction projects, as well as many residential construction projects, normally require specified products to be certified. Badeloft sinks and bathtubs are UPC/cUPC certified, facilitating their use in all types of projects. </p>

                            <h4>Is the weight of the tub something I should consider when buying a Badeloft USA bathtub? </h4>
                            <p>Provided that the building is structurally sound, the weight of the filled bathtub (i.e., approximately the weight of 5 adults) should not be of concern. If you do not know if your building can support this weight, please consult an engineer/architect. </p>
                            <h4>What is the insulation capacity or heat capacity of stone resin?</h4>
                            <p>The insulation capacity of stone resin is very efficient; however, the surface area of the bathtub is large and hot water evaporates. To extend your bathing time for as long as possible, we recommend that you run the water hot to start and cool it down as the bath fills up. </p>
                            <h4>What is the difference between a matte and gloss finish? </h4>
                            <p>Regarding the finishes, it really comes down to your design, what kind of look you are going for and personal preference. The biggest difference between the two is one is shiny and one is not. For our tubs, the Matte finish is the better seller. It gives a more contemporary, modern look. Most clients feel, if they are going to buy a tub like ours, they want it to be the focal point of their bathroom and if the toilet and sinks are already in a Glossy finish, the tub being in Matte will help it stand out or 'pop' more. However, like anything in Matte, it shows 'use' more often and (depending how often it is being used) requires a tad more conscious proactive cleaning. i.e. a little spray and wipe down after use, etc. The Gloss will be a tad easier to clean due to the sleekness of it. A great quality of Stone Resin is after time, if you accidentally scratch it, scuff it, smudge it, even chip it, you can fix it. You cannot do the with acrylic, fiber glass, iron tubs. It is easier to fix the Matte finish as you do not have the added extra step of re-applying the gloss polish to the compromised area with the Gloss finish, however, both can be fixed. To see these two styles for yourself, please request a free 4”X4” material sample from Badeloft USA. </p>
                            <h4>Do the wall-mounted sinks and counter top sinks already have sink holes for the faucets? </h4>
                            <p>All of our sinks do not arrive pre-drilled faucet holes. This way, you have the choice to use either a wall-mount or deck mount faucet. The sink holes for the faucets can be easily drilled in 5 minutes if your read and follow the below drilling guidelines:</p>
